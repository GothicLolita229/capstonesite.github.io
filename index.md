# Our Capstone Project


This project will be helpful for:
<ul>
  
  <li><strong>Neurospicy minds</strong> - an application that can take some of that decision fatigue off your mind</li>

  <li><strong>Personlized plans</strong> - You can choose what type of planning you'd like this to do, whether it be storing your favorite restaurants and then choosing one or randomly helping you decide on a recipe for dinner</li>
  
  <li><strong>Experience New Adventures</strong> - if you're stuck in a rut and you don't have the brain space to decide on activities to kill that boredom, this app is for you</li>

</ul>
